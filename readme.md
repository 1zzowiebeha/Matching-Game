# Blazor Matching Game

This is an adaptation of a project that can be found in Head First C# 5th Ed.

I added some CSS animations and made some fun card graphics.
It uses nested styles which are a relatively new feature in CSS.

# ❗ Note to readers

BEM is something I learned quite a bit after writing this project. BEM decouples the document from its styles via
a component architecture, which makes the code-base more maintainable.
